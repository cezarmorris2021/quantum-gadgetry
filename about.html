        <h2>Agency Dossier</h2>
        <p>
          Quantum Gadgetry operates as a fictional global intelligence supply division – sourcing real‑world tools
          and devices inspired by the kind of equipment you would expect from an off‑grid, deniable operations unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          While our branding, missions, and field notes speak the language of covert ops, the products themselves are
          intended for everyday civilian use: personal security, preparedness, creative filmmaking, urban exploration,
          and tech experimentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          All recommendations and listings are curated by <span class="accent">Agent C.M.</span>, the anonymous
          operations director behind the Quantum Intelligence Division.
        </p>

        <h2>Reality Check &amp; Legal Notice</h2>
        <p>
          Quantum Gadgetry is an entertainment and education brand. We do not sell weapons, we do not endorse illegal
          activity, and we encourage every visitor to strictly comply with all local, state, and federal laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the products featured here are sourced via third‑party platforms such as Amazon through affiliate

        </p>
        <p>
          In short: enjoy the spy‑movie aesthetic, gear up responsibly, and treat this agency as your creative outlet –
          not a license to break the rules.

      <h2>Directive from Agent C.M.</h2>
      <p>
        "Your environment is your staging ground. Whether you are operating out of a cramped apartment, a truck on
        standby, or a full urban base, the right tools change how you move. Equip wisely, stay sharp, and use this
        agency to upgrade your everyday ops."
