===================================

This folder gives you a clean starting point to launch the channel WITHOUT getting stuck.

FILES
-----

branding_and_setup.txt
- Channel name, tagline, About section, keyword ideas, and upload strategy.

shorts_10_starter_scripts.txt
- 10 plug-and-play short-form video scripts.
- Use the same structure for more shorts: HOOK -> BODY -> CTA.
- Record them with a confident, energetic male voice (AI or human).

long_videos_3_outlines.txt
- 3 detailed outlines for long-form videos that fit the Passive Hustle TV brand.

HOW TO USE
----------

1) Set up your YouTube channel:
   - Name: Passive Hustle TV
   - Add the banner / logo once you have them.
   - Paste the About section from branding_and_setup.txt.

2) Record or generate videos:
   - Start with the 10 shorts.
   - You can record audio yourself OR feed the scripts into a text-to-speech tool.
   - Add simple B-roll: money, city, work, computer, notes, phone, etc.

3) Thumbnails:
   - Use dark backgrounds, white text, and tactical red accents.
   - Title text should be short (2–4 words): "BROKE HABITS", "NO CASH HUSTLES", etc.

4) Posting:
   - Aim for 1–2 shorts per day at first.
   - Drop 1 long video per week using the outlines.

NEXT STEPS
----------

If you paste any of these scripts or outlines into ChatGPT and say,
"Turn this into a full YouTube script with voiceover and scene directions,"
you can get point-by-point direction for recording or editing.

This is the foundation. Once these are live and moving, we can expand to a full 30+ video pack.
